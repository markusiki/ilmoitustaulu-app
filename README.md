The idea of this project is to replace the traditional announcement board with an interactive, electronic version. The board has three sections: advertisements, sale announcements, and customer wishes. In the advertisement section, the board's owner can add their own advertisements, while the other sections are for customers, who can add their own announcements to the board by scanning the QR code on the board. In addition to HTTP requests, the application uses WebSocket for real-time communication between the client and server.
